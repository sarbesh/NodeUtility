# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#### CFPB Open Source Project Template Instructions

1. Create a new project.
2. [Copy these files into the new project](#installation)
3. Update the README, replacing the contents below as prescribed.
4. Add any libraries, assets, or hard dependencies whose source code will be included
   in the project's repository to the _Exceptions_ section in the [TERMS](TERMS.md).
  - If no exceptions are needed, remove that section from TERMS.
5. If working with an existing code base, answer the questions on the [open source checklist](opensource-checklist.md)
6. Delete these instructions and everything up to the _Project Title_ from the README.
7. Write some great software and tell people about it.

> Keep the README fresh! It's the first thing people see and will make the initial impression.

## Installation

To install all of the template files, run the following script from the root of your project's directory:

```
bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CFPB/development/master/open-source-template.sh)"
```

# Project Title

**Description**:  Put a meaningful, short, plain-language description of what
this project is trying to accomplish and why it matters.
Describe the problem(s) this project solves.
Describe how this software can improve the lives of its audience.

Other things to include:

  - **Technology stack**: Indicate the technological nature of the software, including primary programming language(s) and whether the software is intended as standalone or as a module in a framework or other ecosystem.
  - **Status**:  Alpha, Beta, 1.1, etc. It's OK to write a sentence, too. The goal is to let interested people know where this project is at. This is also a good place to link to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
  - **Links to production or demo instances**
  - Describe what sets this apart from related-projects. Linking to another doc or page is OK if this can't be expressed in a sentence or two.


**Screenshot**: If the software has visual components, place a screenshot after the description; e.g.,

This includes programming languages, databases or other storage mechanisms, build tools, frameworks, and so forth.
If specific versions of other software are required, or known not to work, call that out.

## Installation

Detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and get the project running.
This should be frequently tested to ensure reliability. Alternatively, link to
a separate [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) document.

## Configuration

If the software is configurable, describe it in detail, either here or in other documentation to which you link.

## Usage

Show users how to use the software.
Be specific.
Use appropriate formatting when showing code snippets.

## How to test the software

If the software includes automated tests, detail how to run those tests.

## Known issues

Document any known significant shortcomings with the software.

## Getting help

Instruct users how to get help with this software; this might include links to an issue tracker, wiki, mailing list, etc.

**Example**

If you have questions, concerns, bug reports, etc, please file an issue in this repository's Issue Tracker.

## Getting involved

This section should detail why people should get involved and describe key areas you are
currently focusing on; e.g., trying to get feedback on features, fixing certain bugs, building
important pieces, etc.

General instructions on _how_ to contribute should be stated with a link to [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
